        <p> 100,000 people die every year in the US due to hospital infections. 
        Many of these could be prevented with proper hand hygiene. 
        Currently, handwashing initiatives have not yet reached the goal of 95% compliance to health guidelines. The SudBudâ„¢  device is a friendly alert system to promote proper hand hygiene. 
        This ICU handwashing recognition system combines practical visual alerts with wifi tracking of hospital-wide handwashing compliance in a compact and easy to implement system. 
        <br><br> Shown in the next section is sample data collected from this system.

            <p>This figure illustrates hand washing data gathered in the last hour. 
            The percentage of complete cycles represents the number of hand washing cycles that were executed for the full 20 second countdown interval. 
            If a cycle was started and the user left before the end of the countdown, then that cycle is counted as incomplete

            <p>As shown above, SudBud tracks hand washing cycles over the course of the day. 
            Every hour, the average compliance data is plotted on this chart. 
            The time is represented on the x-axis using military time.

            <p>This plot tracks daily averages for the past 30 days.
            At the end of each day, the line plot shifts one day to the left and the average compliance of the most recent day is appended to the right side of the graph.
